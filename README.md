# Smart-Waste-Classifier

Trash has become a major problem in everyday life. Until now there is no right method to handle it. Sri Lanka generates 7000MT of solid waste per day with the Western Province accounting for nearly 60% of waste generation.  Each person generates an average of 1-0.4kg of waste per day.  According to the Waste Management Authority and the Central Environmental Authority, only half of the waste generated is collected. Across Sri Lanka, municipal waste is regularly discarded in open garbage dumps, many of which are located near protected areas and other wildlife habitats, drawing elephants there in search of food. Solid waste, especially Municipal Solid Waste [MSW], is a growing problem in urban areas of Sri Lanka. This problem is aggravated due to the country's lack of proper solid waste management systems. Currently, solid waste is collected in a mixed state and dumped in environmentally very sensitive places like roadsides, marshy lands, low-lying areas, public places, forest and wildlife areas, water courses, etc. Therefore, the problem of the excess amount of trash cannot be resolved by applying the manual sorting method. To overcome the problem, we propose a method of development of the trash splitter with three different sensors to distinguish the type of trash. The sorting of large amounts of trash is easier to use by using sensors. There are three sensors that used infrared, inductive, and soil moisture to distinguish dry, metal, and wet waste. The trash can be detected and classified according to its kind.
